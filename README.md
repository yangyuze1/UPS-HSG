# UPS-HSG: Uncalibrated Photometric Stereo Based on Adaptive Hybrid Spherical Gaussian

This repository will host the official implementation of **UPS-HSG**, a self-supervised uncalibrated photometric stereo network.  
The code and pretrained models are currently being prepared for release.

## Status
ðŸš§ **Coming Soon**  
We are cleaning up the source code, organizing experiments, and preparing documentation for public release.

## Planned Release
The open-source version is expected to include:
- Full training and inference code
- Pretrained weights
- Example datasets and usage instructions
- Scripts for evaluation and reproduction of paper results
